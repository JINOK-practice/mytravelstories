## Description
This project was copied from another repository using the **fork** feature in Github. I tested freely without affecting the original. First, applied HTML, CSS, bootstrap and changed the static page to a responsive web page. I focused on making sure that the web page layout is displayed in the appropriate size depending on the screen size of the user.
